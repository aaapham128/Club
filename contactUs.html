<h3>Aaa (Chick) Ken</h3>

<p>Hello members and prospective members of our Co-Learning community! My name is Aaa “Chick” Ken, the founder of Co-Learning. I started Co-Learning because I wanted to produce my own mixtape. Adobe Audition was my first experience with computer programs like I pushed myself onto the deep end of the pool. I shared my first mixtape with one with one of my bro friends and he thought it sounded like I dissed the songs I used because it didn’t flow together at all. He suggested I edit in a transition and showed me how to create a smooth transition using a “Diss Yourself Track” he created in Audition. After that we exchanged our tracks and shared what we learned from each rap we created.
